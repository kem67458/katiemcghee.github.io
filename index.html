<H1 style="color:pink;">All About Katie</H1></center>
<p style=color:white;">My name is Katie Beth McGhee, and I am a sopohmore at the University of Georgia. I am majoring in accounting, and I intend to obtain a master's degree. I am from a small town in south Georgia, so I have a thick Southern accent. My favortie foods include sushi, chicken nuggets, and pickles. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, going to the gym, cheering the bulldogs on every Saturday, and going downtown. I work at Chick-Fil-A, so I do not have much free time, but when I do, it is spent with my roommates watching movies or having a nerf gun war. An interesting fact about myself is that I had never heard of CostCo until I moved to Athens.</p>

<H2 style=color:pink;"> Katie's Daily Schedule</H2></center>
<p style=color:white;">I try to keep each day as routine as possible. However, in college, it can often be dificult to keep a schedule when balancing your social, work, and school life. Often times I find myself straying from my schedule to hang out with friends or make a quick trip to the grocery store. To make things easier, each day, I make myself a schedule that (for the most part) I stick to. This is not to say that you should exactly follow the scheule. Take some breaks, and have some time to yourself. Don't become so consumed by the schedule that you end up stressing yourself out more. Below I have attached my daily class schedule, and below that, I have attached a table that displays how I spend my free time throughout that day. </p>

<H3 style=color:pink;">Katie's Tips for Balancing Work, Social, and School Life</H3></center>
<p style=color:white;">Coming to college was definitely a huge change for me. I had to learn how to efficiently balance my time so I could work, finish school work, and still have time to go out with friends. To do this, I put them in an order from most important to least important. First was school, then work, and then (despite popular opinion), a social life. Even though I made many schedules, I still found it difficult to avoid being stressed. I tried a few stress relieving strategies including breathing, exercising, and meditating. Meditation proved to be the best method to managing my stress and/or anxiety. I encourage you to find what method is best for you, but since meditation proved to work for me, I decided to provide a link to a site that shows the steps for meditation.</p>

I encourage you to watch if you are ever feeling stressed or overwhelmed. She encourages those who feel stress to focus on the positives. While this is easier said than done, finding the positives in your day (seeing friends, watching a movie, or even a friendly smile) can help relieve the tensions of college life. </H5></center>
